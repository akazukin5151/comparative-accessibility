# initial analysis
## network
london has 6x more stops per km2 than delhi

some routes in london have few stops as seen in the bottom left corner of the chart in the bottom left

## centrality

edge effects on the east: the delhi metropolis actually expands to the east to the state of Haryana. This analysis was limited to the NCT, so the edge effects are misleading. London has a more uni-centric network with only one dense core and a uniformly low density border. The eastern border in Delhi still has high density

so cc is like 1/(shortest_distance(u, n-1)
if our cc is lower then it means the shortest_distance between every node to every other node is longer
which makes sense i think
because our study area is much larger
inevitably there will be huge distances
so some of the shortest_distance(u, n) will be big, meaning cc will be small

# expected findings
## cumulative accessibility
cumulative accessibility is like % of people within 15m walk of a bus stop

there's less bus stops in the NW (slide 4) and less roads (slide 7) and the roads are not well supported, so there will be less people near bus stops

TODO but cumulative accessibility can also be like % of people within 15m walk of schools

## areas more in need of better infrastructure
London's bus network is rather uniform spatially, but I would expect Delhi's bus network lacking in the (north+south)west

## further research
Straightness: I'd expect Delhi to have lower straightness than london because of more informal roads

TODO expectations for betweeness
TODO non transport accessibility
